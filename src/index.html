                        When you use VPVC, the app repeatedly takes a screenshot of your game
                        and analyzes it to find out whether you're in the lobby, agent select
                        or in-game, and your position on the map. This method of detecting
                        your location isn't perfect but it ensures VPVC is safe to use
                        and will not lead to any game bans.
                        <br><br>
                        While in the lobby, everyone in your party can hear each other.<br>
                        In agent select, you can only hear members of your own team.<br>
                        During gameplay, the volume of other players is determined by
                        their distance on the map to you.
                        <br><br>
                        VPVC has voice chat built in so you don't need to install or use
                        any additional software.

                        When you create a party in the app, you get a code that

                        While technically possible, it's not recommended

                        VPVC is not signed (verified) using an

                        quite expensive to obtain. This is a factor that may lead
                        Windows and some anti-virus programs to be cautious about VPVC.

                        There are multiple reasons why the extraction
                        of your in-game location can fail.
                        Make sure you correctly configured your game
                        according to the instructions displayed
                        when you open the app.
                        Your enemy highlight color
                        needs to be set to red or purple because
                        the color of the minimap marker changes
                        when you switch to another color.
                        Check that you selected the screen
                        your game is running on when launching the
                        app.

                        Why is my microphone not working correctly?

                    <p class="mt-3 text-md md:text-lg leading-snug">
                        VPVC uses the microphone set as default in
                        your Windows settings. If VPVC isn't using
                        the correct microphone, change your default microphone.
                        Also, there are some known incompatibilities
                        with Voicemeeter so try disabling it and check
                        if that solves your problem.
                    </p>

                        Can I get banned for using VPVC?

                    <p class="mt-3 text-md md:text-lg leading-snug">
                        No. VPVC works by taking screenshots of the game to
                        detect your position and does not directly interact
                        with the game in any way and will therefore not lead
                        to a ban by the game's anti-cheat.
